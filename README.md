# Workout-automation
A customizable workout tracking app, for free too!!!


You can easily edit the code once you read it from start to end. The code is very easy to understand with the expected user to know very low coding knowledge.
This script will use an email, and send that email to your phone. You can always customize how that works though (email to email).
You will require whatever current conditions are for sending emails with Python. When this project was made, we needed an authorization code, you may need to change it in future if Google does something radical again.
